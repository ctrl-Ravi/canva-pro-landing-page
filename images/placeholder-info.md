# Image Placeholders

Since we can't directly generate images, you'll need to create or download the following images:

## Required Images

1. **canva-hero.png** (500x400px)
   - This should showcase Canva Pro features or interface
   - Use a high-quality image that shows Canva's design interface
   - You can use a screenshot from Canva's website or create a custom graphic

2. **avatar-1.jpg, avatar-2.jpg, avatar-3.jpg** (50x50px)
   - These are for the testimonial section
   - Use professional-looking headshot images
   - You can use stock photos or placeholder services

## Placeholder Services

You can use these online services to generate placeholder images:

- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) - Simple colored placeholders
- [Placekitten.com](https://placekitten.com/) - Placeholder images with kittens
- [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-quality stock photos

## Example URLs for Placeholders

For quick testing, you can use these direct URLs in your HTML:

```
Hero Image:
https://via.placeholder.com/500x400/6200ee/ffffff?text=Canva+Pro+Features

Avatars:
https://via.placeholder.com/50x50/cccccc/666666?text=User+1
https://via.placeholder.com/50x50/cccccc/666666?text=User+2
https://via.placeholder.com/50x50/cccccc/666666?text=User+3
```

Replace these with your actual images for the production site.
